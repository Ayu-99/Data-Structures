/*
Find a node in LL (recursive)
Send Feedback
Given a linked list and an integer n you need to find and return index where n is present in the LL. Do this recursively.
Return -1 if n is not present in the LL.
Indexing of nodes starts from 0.
Input format :
Line 1 : Linked list elements (separated by space and terminated by -1)
Line 2 : Integer n 
Output format :
Index
Sample Input 1 :
3 4 5 2 6 1 9 -1
5
Sample Output 1 :
2
Sample Input 2 :
3 4 5 2 6 1 9 -1
6
Sample Output 2 :
4
